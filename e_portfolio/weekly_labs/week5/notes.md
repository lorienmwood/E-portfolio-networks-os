# Networks and Operating Systems - Transport Layer Part 2

## Notes
- This Lab we looked at the transport layer focusing on TCP (transmission contorl protcol)


## Exercises
- Exercise 1: Use python datetime library to measure how long it took to send the data. 
- Exercise 2: Change your script so that the data will be send using UDP and compare the time needed to send it using both protocols
- Exercise 3: Change your txt file to be a whole paragraph and compare the time needed to send it.
- Exercise 4: Resend the new txt file using UDP and compare the time needed. 
- Exercise 5: Implement a TCP server that can connect to multiple clients and receive data from them simultaneously.
- Exercise 6: Implement chat application for 2 clients
- Exercise 7: Add encryption for secure messaging (use the cryptography library).
- Exercise 8: Fetch weather data from an API and send it over TCP.
